## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nikhil DP

As a passionate and dedicated software developer, I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Applications and have honed my skills through a comprehensive Python Full Stack course at Besant Technologies, Rajajinagar. My expertise spans across front-end and back-end development, where I have gained practical experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications.
